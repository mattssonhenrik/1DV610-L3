# Project Vision: MovieDecider

## Background

In a time of doom-scrolling, dopamin addiction and procrastination, I believe that there is a high risk that humanity will have a general decline in brain power where some few will continue to propell humanity into new technologies but the broad mass will be dumbing down (not to the extreme of the movie Idiocracy but that general direction). The Quiz-application can turn inproductive screen time in to a mind-exercising activity. 

## Problem

People need to use their wits in order to keep and evolve them, just like any other muscles the brain has to be exercised. I believe that most people do enjoy a good riddle which is an excellent way of using and challanging your brain into thinking and analyzing. The Quiz-application is a fun way to solve riddles where you can choose the topic of your choise, the questions are 3 random questions each time and have a visual stimulus of both correct and incorrect input and answer which should be able to stimulate the users dopamin craving. 

## Market

The market can be everything from sudoko-solvers that just naturally likes theoretical challanges, elderly people at nursery homes trying to vitalize and preserve their brain functions, school students which need to warm up their brain for the coming school activities, people that wants to spend their free time on productive and/or beneficial activities, basically everybody could benefit from solving daily riddles.

## Competing Solutions
There are some big quiz-applications out there already, such as Kahoot and Quizlet. The USP to The Quiz-application is that there is a input filter which guides the user if their input is of the right set of characters or not.
